# LAB | Building a sentiment analysis


## Introduction

We have just learned how to integrate LLMs via APIs and how they can be used with flask, let's understand first how nlp can be used for sentiment analysis and how the LLM would achieve this under the hood by using a pre-trained model.

In following sessions and labs we will start working directly with the openAI cloud APIs.

## Requirements

1. Follow the provided link to download the notebook and/or data needed for this lab: [S4-Lab Building a sentiment analysis](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zi-qsw1bRwsMgXpt0yjAQT-Ddy85KSwi?usp=sharing)
2. Upload the notebook inside the lab to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Submission

Once you finish the assignment, submit a URL link to your colab notebook in the field on Student Portal. (**Reminder**: The link to your notebook needs to be public.)

## Tasks

### Task 1

Using the confusion matrix calculate and explain metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Task 2 (Bonus)

Integrate the sentiment analysis classifier with flask.
